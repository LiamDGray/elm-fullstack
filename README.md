# Kalmit

*Simple development and operation of web services*

Implement your web service the simple way, using the [Elm programming language](https://elm-lang.org):

+ Don't worry about connecting to a database or losing application state: The runtime persists each `update` so the app state can be restored. To learn more about this feature, see the [guide on persistence in Kalmit](./guide/persistence-in-kalmit.md)
+ HTTP requests and responses are mapped to Elm types so that you can work with a strongly typed interface.

To help you with the operation side, the Kalmit web host supports configuring common functionality:

+ Admin interface to read and set the app state, in case you want to manually intervene or monitor.
+ Automatically get and renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.
+ Rate-limit client HTTP requests which result in updates of your app.
+ Serve static files on selected paths.
