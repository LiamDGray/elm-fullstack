# Kalmit

*Simple Persistent Processes*

Kalmit supports modeling a persistent process using the Elm programming language, by providing:
+ A framework to automatically persist the process state and restore the app state when the server restarts.
+ A web server to host a persistent process as a web service:
  + HTTP requests and responses are mapped to Elm types.
  + Admin interface to read and set the process state.
  + Additional common functionality like static files, rate-limiting, CORS.

## Deployment

+ For configuring for deployment to Azure app service, see [guide/operate-persistent-process.md](./guide/operate-persistent-process.md)
