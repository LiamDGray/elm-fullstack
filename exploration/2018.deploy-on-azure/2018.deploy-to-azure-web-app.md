## Deploy To Azure App Service

I explored the process to deploy to Azure App Service.
Parts of the implementation of the persistent process depend on the Elm executable. Most effort went into the resulting dependencies and setup.

### Elm Make Fails With 'No Store'

Elm failed with following output:
```standardoutput
name-used-to-execute-file.exe: no store
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at .\System\X509\Win32.hs:56:31 in x509-system-1.6.6-KPlAgjlEOhtBXlrzCCJ22B:System.X509.Win32
```

This error went away after changing application settings in the Azure web app as follows:
Set `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` to `*`, as described at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/using-certificates-in-azure-websites-applications/

### Elm Make HTTPS Certificate Problem

When using `elm make` with a command line like this:
```cmd
elm make StringBuilderWebApp.elm
```

It failed with the following output:
```
-- HTTP PROBLEM ----------------------------------------------------------------

The following HTTP request failed:

    <https://package.elm-lang.org/all-packages>

Here is the error message I was able to extract:

    HttpExceptionRequest Request { host = "package.elm-lang.o
rg" port = 443
    secure = True requestHeaders =
    [("User-Agent","elm/0.19.0"),("Accept-Encoding","gzip")] path =
    "/all-packages" queryString = "" method = "GET" proxy = Nothing rawBody =
    False redirectCount = 10 responseTimeout = ResponseTimeoutDefault
    requestVersion = HTTP/1.1 } (InternalException (HandshakeFailed
    (Error_Protocol ("certificate has unknown CA",True,UnknownCa))))
```

#### Solution

(From the discussion at https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-solve-elm-make-https-certificate-problem/2546/5?u=viir)

Looks like I got it working by installing a certificate.
I downloaded the certificate from package.elm-lang.org and added it as a `Public Certificate` to the Azure app.

I used the export UI of the chrome browser to get a `.cer` file for a certificate on the path displayed in the chrome browser (I took the `DST Root CA X3` from the root)

The import of this file went without error messages.

But at first, the elm make command still displayed the `certificate has unknown CA` error.
Yesterday, it was too late to continue investigating, and now after coming back it works, elm make produces the output file. I don't know what happened in the meantime, maybe the host system was restarted.

While setting the certificate up, I also found this guide helpful to check if the certificate was loaded: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/karansingh/2017/03/15/azure-app-services-how-to-determine-if-the-client-certificate-is-loaded/

### Elm Make Fails On `getAppUserDataDirectory`

When trying to use the elm executable with the `make` command, it failed with output like this:
```standard-output
elm.exe: getAppUserDataDirectory:sHGetFolderPath: illegal operation (unsupported operation)
```

More information about the problem is found at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory-1.3.3.1/docs/System-Directory.html#v:getAppUserDataDirectory :

> The argument is usually the name of the application. Since it will be integrated into the path, it must consist of valid path characters.  
>  
> + On Unix-like systems, the path is ~/.<app>.  
> + On Windows, the path is %APPDATA%/<app> (e.g. C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/<app>)  
> Note: the directory may not actually exist, in which case you would need to create it. It is expected that the parent directory exists and is writable.  
>  
> The operation may fail with:  
>  
> + `UnsupportedOperation` The operating system has no notion of application-specific data directory.  
> + `isDoesNotExistError` The home directory for the current user does not exist, or cannot be found.

As Markus Laire points out [on the elm-lang forum](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-get-around-elm-make-error-on-getappuserdatadirectory/2551/2?u=viir), for the special case of elm, this problem can be avoided by setting `ELM_HOME` for the elm make process. This approach made it possible to fix the problem in the framework implementation, so that no setup is required to account for this.

### 2019-01-26 Again Elm Make HTTPS Certificate Problem

On 2019-01-26, Elm make fails again:
```
System.NotImplementedException: Output file not found. Maybe the output from the Elm make process helps to find the cause: Exit Code: 1 Standard Output: '' Standard Error: '-- HTTP PROBLEM ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The following HTTP request failed:
 
 <https://package.elm-lang.org/all-packages>
 
 Here is the error message I was able to extract:
 
 HttpExceptionRequest Request { host = "package.elm-lang.org" port = 443

 + This instance is hosted in an Azure Web App which and worked a few weeks earlier.
 + I do not remember changing anything in this App. Did Microsoft change something in how the certificates are propagated? I do not find a clue online. Azure exhibited problems depending on the Region before (Cosmos DB) so document some details about the App Service Plan displayed in the Azure Portal: `Location: North Europe` `App Service Plan: general (Basic: 1 Small)`.
 + Is the problem specific to the state App Service Plan? Test with a new Web App running on a new App Service Plan. For the new web app `kalmit-web-host-livetest-2`, create New App Service Plan in region `East US` and pricing plan `B1 Basic`.
 + In addition to the Kalmit deployment, add the root certificate used when opening https://package.elm-lang.org in chrome : `DAC9024F54D8F6DF94935FB1732638CA6AD77C13`
 + On this new web app, get an error too:
 ```
 System.NotImplementedException: Output file not found. Maybe the output from the Elm make process helps to find the cause:
Exit Code: 1
Standard Output:
''
Standard Error:
'-- HTTP PROBLEM ----------------------------------------------------------------

The following HTTP request failed:

    requestVersion = HTTP/1.1 } (InternalException (HandshakeFailed

```
+ What happens if the certificate is removed from the Web App? After deleting the certificate in Azure Portal and restarting the app, get the `certificate has unknown CA` error again. So maybe the certificate is not propagated into the app scope, to begin with?
+ Upload the certificate again to continue testing.
+ Check in Kudu: Under environment, it also displays `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES = *`.
+ Use powershell to dump info about certificates: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse Cert: 2>&1 > .\cert.log`. In the resulting file, `DAC9024F54D8F6DF94935FB1732638CA6AD77C13` is found in this entry:
```
[...]

               System.Security.Cryptography.Oid, 
               System.Security.Cryptography.Oid}
[...]
```
+ So the certificate is contained in the `My` scope. Is this not sufficient anymore for elm make? Can we add the certificate to a larger scope? Can we start the elm process in a different way so that it has access to the certificate?
